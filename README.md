## Hi there. I am currently looking to change careers from a physiotherapist into a front end web developer. I am currently learning full stack development and working on a few projects to demonstrate what I have learned.  ðŸ‘‹

# About Me: 
I am currently working as an NHS Physiotherapist, but looking to transition into a career in web development. 
I have taken part in Codecademy Front End Development Course and also completed self-directed learning.
